```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(openxlsx)
candy <- read.xlsx(here("clean_data/clean_candy.xlsx"))
```

What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)

```{r}
# this selects all candy columns, mutates them into a logical TRUE or FALSE depending on if they are NA or if they have values
# from there, sums all the values that are TRUE
# after, it sums those values into a new column - giving us the total amount of ratings
# The total ratings is 386924 out of 1131229 possible (9349*121) 

candy %>% 
  select(!c(year, age, gender, country, going_trick_or_treating)) %>% 
  mutate(across(.col = is.character, .fns = is.na)) %>% 
  summarise(across(.col = where(is.logical), .fns = sum)) %>%
  mutate(total_ratings = sum(across(where(is.integer)))) %>% 
  select(total_ratings)
```

What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating?

```{r}
candy %>% 
  select(age, going_trick_or_treating) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(going_trick_or_treating == "Yes") %>% 
  mutate(avg_age_T_T = mean(age))
```


What was the average age of people who are not going trick or treating?
